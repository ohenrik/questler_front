# Questler - Front end
This is the front end of the tutorial site **Questler**.
The back end is found here:
https://github.com/ohenrik/questler

## Consept
The basic idea of questler is to help people create maintainable and high quality tutorials by borrowing concepts from the StackExchange network. In Questler, a tutorial is divided into small modules consisting of clues and implementation. A clue explains a new concepts. Clues are often complimented by examples of how a concept is used in the context of the current tutorial, these modules are called Implementations. Users earn points through up-votes on their tutorials (quests), clues or implementations. They can also contribute to a tutorial by modifying or creating new versions of a tutorial, Clue or Implementation.
